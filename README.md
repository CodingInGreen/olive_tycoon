Olive Tycoon is played entirely through your terminal. Here are the commands to start building your olive empire:

### Buy an Orchard

To purchase a new orchard, use the `buy` command:

```bash
cargo run -- hire "Olivia" "Picker"

Just replace `"Olivia"` with the first name and `"Picker"` with the last name of your new employee.
